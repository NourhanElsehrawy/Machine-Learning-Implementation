# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains clean, well-documented implementations of classic machine learning algorithms **from scratch**, without using machine learning libraries. The goal is to deepen understanding of how algorithms work internally and provide educational reference code.

## 🚀 Features

* Implementations built using only core Python (and optionally NumPy)
* Clear, modular code structure
* Inline comments explaining each step
* Practical examples for each algorithm
* Easy to extend and experiment with


## 📘 Algorithms Implemented

* **Supervised Learning**

  * Decision Trees
  
* **Unsupervised Learning**

  * K-Means Clustering (coming soon)
